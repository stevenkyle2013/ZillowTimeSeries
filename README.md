## Conclusion
Out of the 110 zipcoes that we have data on the best zipcodes to invest in are: 83858, 83605, 83350, 83845, and 83347. The predicted 1 year ROI spans from 5.48%-19.23%. Investment in zipcode 83347 warrants caution since the low 1 year prediction shows that there is the possibility that we would lose money on the investment.

## Recommendation
- Smaller cities seem to be experiencing more growth in price
- Areas where the median housing price is less than 300,000 seem to have a better ROI
